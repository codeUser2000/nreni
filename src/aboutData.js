    title: 'What Is Sterling Silver?',
    desc: 'You might wonder: is sterling silver real silver? The answer is a definite yes. Sterling silver is simply an alloyed form of silver which is much more suitable to use in jewellery and other metalwork.\n'
      + '\n'
      + 'Fine silver is 99.9% pure silver. In this form the metal is beautiful and suffers from minimal tarnish, but it\'s generally too soft and malleable for many uses, including making most silver jewellery.\n'
      + '\n'
      + 'Instead fine silver is alloyed with copper to create sterling silver, which is 92.5% pure silver and 7.5% copper. This percentage of fine silver is why you will sometimes see sterling silver referred to as \'925 silver\' or hallmarked with a 925 stamp.\n'
      + '\n'
      + 'The copper makes the silver harder, more durable and therefore much better to work with and use, but without compromising on colour. Most silver jewellery that you buy and wear will be sterling silver.\n'
      + '\n'
      + 'Can silver jewellery turn black? The answer is also: yes - and it\'s to be expected and is easy enough to resolve.\n'
      + '\n'
      + 'The copper added to sterling silver will cause it to tarnish more easily, with the metal turning dark brown or black over time, especially in humid conditions. However, it\'s easy to clean and beneath the tarnish your sterling silver will still be in great condition: it won\'t rust or perish with normal use',

    title: 'Silver Or Old Jewelry?',
    desc: 'Your choice of silver jewellery or gold jewellery is primarily down to personal preference, but unless you\'re particularly wealthy, a major deciding factor is cost. It may come as a surprise to learn that although silver is of course a precious metal, it\'s vastly less expensive than gold.\n'
      + '\n'
      + 'How much less expensive? At the time of writing silver is about a whopping 75 times less expensive than gold. This makes gathering a solid gold jewellery collection a very pricey option by comparison to silver.\n'
      + '\n'
      + 'The reason is primarily that there is considerably more silver in the world than gold. It\'s estimated that 1.4 million tonnes of silver has been mined throughout human history, while only 173,000 tonnes of gold have been mined.',
