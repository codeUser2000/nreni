    desc: 'Tarnishing is a natural process which is caused by oxygen and moisture coming into contact with various types of metal. If your once shiny metal has turned dull and dark or even looks like it has dark stains, this is likely to be the reason why.\n'

      + 'Understanding tarnish is key to cleaning your jewellery. All precious metals can tarnish to some degree. Platinum and pure gold are the most tarnish-resistant metals and will show very minimal (if any) tarnish over many years.\n'
      + '\n'
      + 'By contrast, sterling silver jewellery will tarnish relatively easily, meaning it will turn a brown, grey or black colour over time. This is a normal process.\n'
      + '\n'
      + 'You may have read that pure or fine silver won\'t tarnish, but that isnâ€™t true: it does, just more slowly and in a less noticeable way than sterling silver. Pure silver can be cleaned in the same way as sterling silver.\n'
      + '\n'
      + 'The reason sterling silver tarnishes more easily is because it is an alloy of pure silver with copper. This has the benefit of making the metal harder and much more suitable for making jewellery than pure silver, which is too soft for many uses. The downside is that the small amount of copper content will tarnish more noticeably over time.',

    desc: 'Tarnish appearing on your silver jewellery is normal. Even the best silver jewellery tarnishes, so don\'t assume the problem is related to the quality of your jewellery or it not being made of real silver. If anything, tarnish indicates that it really is silver!\n'

      + 'When silver is exposed to gases in the air - especially sulphur - it discolours and darkens as it reacts with the gas to form a layer of tarnish on the surface. A similar process can occur when silver is exposed to an array of other chemicals.\n'

      + 'Having some good quality absorbent kitchen towels on hand is also helpful as the towels will easily mop up water from rinsing your jewellery, making it much easier to finish drying with the soft drying cloth you have set aside.\n'
